1. Image Filtering (Leads: Hal and Farah)
    * a) The 4 Gaussian filters are separable filters, as are the first and second order derivatives that are oriented vertically or horizontally. This would make filters 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39 all separable. 
    * d) Grayscale Thresholding:
        For each filter, I computed a threshold value that would split the data where everything greater than this value is a mammal, and everything less than is a bird. For this, I took the norm of each filtered image, then split them into bird_norms and mammals_norms. If the largest bird_norm was less than the smallest mammal_norm, I took the average of these two values, and set that as the threshold for that filter. Otherwise, the minimum mammal_norm would be the threshold. With this method, filters 14, 15, and 16, all first order derivative filters, were able to get the best classification. With their associated threshold values, they were able to correctly identify all 8 images. This classification method is based on the assumption that the bird norms are less than the mammal norms which, for filters 0-35, is true. 
        The final list of thresholds is: 1.0086085931834663, 1.0093817984046412, 0.9774139212286351, 0.8598662373049294, 0.8802130294773347, 0.9491701758731731, 0.7028308556925308, 0.7109835025380711, 0.7020621827411168, 0.6443844438939806, 0.6549764676740154, 0.6850371646120377, 0.5396174764321973, 0.5543863306744018, 0.5317370624299558, 0.5117107010156057, 0.5091678721823136, 0.532532632342277, 0.32164612037708484, 0.314537708484409, 0.2664899677978697, 0.27084468664850136, 0.26616299232103047, 0.3038179840464104, 0.09402374909354605, 0.08796135744364628, 0.07597225662620757, 0.0754520683675997, 0.06785236561803319, 0.08478077780530097, 0.029465192168237852, 0.02482596084118927, 0.022681290790427848, 0.028942168237853515, 0.023249938072826357, 0.023445431472081217, 201.0512558830815, 221.17237218999276, 228.64426667875273, 234.59520123277738, 148.798399709038, 77.58124931805783, 51.72440443717039, 38.76909256228405, 51.72440443717039, 23.831234769958176, 7.569214402618658, 0.5092562284051646, 618140.0
            * The final threshold is for the summed response. 
    * e) RGB Format:
        The best classifier is no longer the same. Using the same methods, my threshold values were different, and none of them were able to perfectly classify the group of eight images. This pass was, however, a lot more consistent. Filters 0-35 were nearly entirely correct, and classified everything correctly except for the first bird image. The final filters, 36-47, clssified everything as mammals. 
        The final list of thresholds is: 3.1209191443074693, 3.1234109862219, 2.9566955660143672, 2.6000941293039386, 2.6411890017339608, 2.842893237552638, 2.158105511240029, 2.176333393763597, 2.1488769035532993, 1.9431904879861284, 1.958563289571464, 2.116092277012328, 1.6447951414068165, 1.6819760696156636, 1.680084300217549, 1.6035868218974485, 1.6069804310131286, 1.6409662799129805, 1.0083272569444444, 0.9454446371067624, 0.8015011146891255, 0.8227198414664355, 0.8020708446866485, 0.9168255208333334, 0.29846718636693254, 0.26310131285608124, 0.22790686153083972, 0.2277235570968541, 0.20333911320287343, 0.2522764429031459, 0.09607777374909354, 0.08144670050761421, 0.07302121102248006, 0.09179024655547498, 0.06983403517463463, 0.07443437273386512, 561.8210420076377, 656.3985360768673, 685.4718772661349, 705.4531236403191, 397.66315148208764, 210.9112965993817, 140.61666848517913, 105.39749408983451, 140.61666848517913, 64.78721767594108, 20.57806146572104, 1.411656664848154, 0, 3832.031067466812
            The final threshold is for the summed response. 
    * f) Non-separated filters took 23.1 seconds, while computation with the separated filters took 17 seconds. Computation with separable filters is faster.

2. Histogram Equalization
    * b) Given then I is a probability density function, shifting it would affect the the overall intensity of the image. A shift left would alter the probability that a pixel is darker, so by shifting the majority of pixels to the left, the image, I, would get darker. On the other hand, a shift to the right would increase the probability of high pixel intensity, creating a brighter image. If p is stretched, the contrast of the image will decrease, as the majority of the pixels will fall towards the middle intensity. If p is squashed, the contrast of the image will increase, as the probability shifts so that more pixels will be near maximum and minimum intensity.
